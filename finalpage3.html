    <h1>Techniacal Support Scam</h1>

<h2>The Most Common Scam</h2>
<p>The technical support scam is a type of fraud in which scammers impersonate technical support representatives from 
    legitimate companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, or antivirus software providers. These scammers typically use various deceptive tactics
     to trick unsuspecting individuals into believing that their computer has been infected with malware or is experiencing technical issues. Scammers may request remote access to the victim's computer 
     under the guise of diagnosing and resolving technical problems. Once they have access, they can install malicious software, steal personal information, or tamper with the computer's settings. In some cases, scammers may attempt to trick victims into 
     providing personal or financial information, such as credit card numbers or login credentials. This information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes.
